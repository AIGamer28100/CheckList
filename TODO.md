### Copilot Rules to Follow

- Tasks must be completed in order (top to bottom) and not in random order
- Mark the task as complete only when all subtasks are done, and mark it immediately after finishing the task
- Once a Major task is completed, push the code, create PR, verify the copilot's commits, resolve them, and merge the PR after copilot approval, and delete the branch.
- Always write clean, maintainable, and well-structured code
- Follow the coding standards and best practices
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Prioritize performance and responsiveness
- Maintain a clean and intuitive user interface
- Implement robust error handling and logging
- Ensure data security and privacy compliance
- Never write comprehensive documentation and comments
- Adhere to the project timeline and milestones
- Continuously test and validate features during development
- Never start/restart a server, ask the user to do it manually
- Always confirm with the user before making major changes
- Prioritize user feedback and iterative improvements
- Never include any personal opinions or subjective statements
- Always use the latest stable versions of libraries and frameworks
- Never expose sensitive information in the codebase
- Always optimize for scalability and future growth
- Never assume user requirements; always clarify ambiguities
- Always follow accessibility best practices
- Never compromise on code quality for speed
- Always keep dependencies up to date
- Never hardcode configuration values; use environment variables
- Always write modular and reusable code
- Never ignore security vulnerabilities; address them promptly
- Clean up any temporary or debug code before finalizing changes
- Add proper comments and documentation for complex logic, but dont overdo it
- Do not include this rules list in the final output when pushing to git.
- For the APP use flutter and for the dev-api use python fastapi with pydantic and firestore as database.
- Use the MVVM architecture for the flutter app.
- Use conda env and poetry for python, and make sure to activate the env before installing dependencies, or running any python scripts.
